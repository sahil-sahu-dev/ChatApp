## Resources
* Followed along [Lets Build That App's](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/SwiftUI%20Firebase%20Real%20Time%20Chat) course, where I learned how to use firebase to make a chat app. Therefore majority of the UI and many code elements match with this course. However, I Added end to end encrpytion to it on my own.  
* Used [Kishika Wakatsumi's](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/KeychainAccess) repo for making access to keychain easier.
